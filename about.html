    </section>
        <div class="container">
        <p>Hi, I'm Kassim Faisal, an aspiring computer engineer, educator, and tech enthusiast passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. My journey began with an insatiable curiosityâ€”always questioning how things work, from simple circuits to complex computing systems.</p>
        
        <h2>Where It All Began</h2>
        <p>As a child, I once believed that the television housed a miniature civilizationâ€”tiny people living inside the screen, acting out scenes in real-time. That belief didnâ€™t last long, but the question it sparkedâ€”"How does this actually work?"â€”set me on a lifelong quest for understanding. Taking apart old electronics, experimenting with code, and seeking answers became my way of exploring the world. This same curiosity continues to drive my passion for computer engineering today.</p>
        
        <h2>My Passion for Engineering & Innovation</h2>
        <p>That childhood curiosity evolved into a deep fascination with computing and emerging technologies. I am particularly interested in robotics, IoT, and blockchain, as they represent the intersection of hardware and software. Whether itâ€™s designing embedded systems, working with microcontrollers, or exploring decentralized technologies, I enjoy building practical solutions that push the boundaries of innovation.</p>
        
        <h2>Education & Teaching</h2>
        <p>Beyond engineering, Iâ€™m passionate about education and mentorship. Iâ€™ve worked as a private tutor, classroom teacher, and STEM mentor, helping students break away from rote memorization and embrace critical thinking and problem-solving.</p>
        
        <h2>Tech, Research & Future Goals</h2>
        <p>Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my skills in blockchain, AI, and software development, combining my knowledge of computer engineering with cutting-edge technologies to drive innovation. One of my long-term goals is to leverage AI in vehicles to help minimize road accidents by enhancing real-time decision-making and predictive safety mechanisms. I aim to contribute to smart systems, cybersecurity, and emerging computing solutions, empowering others to explore the power of technology.</p>
        
        <p>Thanks for stopping byâ€”let's connect and innovate together! ðŸš€</p>
